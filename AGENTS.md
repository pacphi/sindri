# Sindri — `v1` branch (END OF LIFE)

v1 is the original Bash implementation. **End of life.** No new features, no
behavioral changes. Security backports only.

## Allowed changes

- Critical security patches with a CVE reference.
- Documentation typo fixes.

## Disallowed

- New features.
- Refactoring or cleanup.
- Dependency upgrades except for verified CVE remediation.

## CI

Workflows live on `main` (`.github/workflows/ci-v1.yml`) and only run markdown lint —
v1 has no source to build.

## Source

Only `v1/CHANGELOG.md` exists here.
