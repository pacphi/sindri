version: 3.0.0-simplified
arguments:
  - name: prd_input

# PRD to Complete Documentation - Simplified

**One command. Complete documentation. No complexity.**

---

## What This Does

You provide a PRD. You get:

1. **Specification docs** - Requirements, user stories, API contracts, security model
2. **Domain model (DDD)** - Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, events, database schema
3. **Architecture (ADR)** - All architectural decisions with rationale
4. **Implementation plan** - Milestones, epics, tasks with dependencies
5. **Unified INDEX.md** - Single entry point that ties everything together

---

## Usage

```bash
# Generate documentation only
/prd2build /path/to/your-prd.md

# Generate documentation AND execute build
/prd2build /path/to/your-prd.md --build
```

**Documentation only**: Wait 5-10 minutes. All documentation generated in `docs/`.

**With --build**: Documentation generates first, then mesh swarm executes the complete build following all ADRs and DDD artifacts.

## Input PRD

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Execution (Single Batch)

**CRITICAL**: This runs as ONE concurrent batch. All agents spawn together, work in parallel, report when done.

```javascript
// Initialize system (REQUIRED FIRST)
Bash("mkdir -p docs/{specification,ddd,adr,sparc,implementation/{milestones,epics,tasks},testing,design/mockups}")
Bash("npx @claude-flow/cli@latest init --no-color 2>/dev/null || true")
Bash("npx @claude-flow/cli@latest memory init --force --no-color 2>/dev/null || true")

// Spawn ALL documentation agents in PARALLEL (foreground mode)
// They all run concurrently and block until ALL complete

Task("researcher", `
Read PRD from arguments above.

Generate docs/specification/:
- requirements.md (REQ-XXX IDs, functional requirements)
- non-functional.md (performance, security, scalability targets)
- user-stories.md (As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit])
- user-journeys.md (actor definitions, user flows, use cases)
- api-contracts.md (OpenAPI-style endpoint specs)
- security-model.md (threat model, auth/authz, data classification)
- edge-cases.md (boundary conditions)
- constraints.md (technical and business limits)
- glossary.md (domain terminology)

Extract:
- All requirements with unique IDs
- All actors and their goals
- All API endpoints
- Security requirements (auth methods, encryption, compliance)

MINIMUM QUALITY BARS:
- 8+ specification files
- 15+ user stories (for any real project)
- 10+ API endpoints (if API-based)
- Security model >50 lines (substantial, not just headers)

Store key entities in memory for other agents.
`, "researcher")

Task("ui-designer", `
Read PRD and requirements.md.

CRITICAL: Check for existing style guides BEFORE generating:
- If docs/specification/style-guide.md exists → READ and REUSE it, DO NOT overwrite
- If docs/specification/style-guide.html exists → READ and REUSE it, DO NOT overwrite

Generate design artifacts:
1. docs/specification/wireframes.md (ASCII wireframes, all major screens)
2. docs/specification/style-guide.md (colors, typography, spacing) - ONLY if not exists
3. docs/specification/style-guide.html (interactive visual guide) - ONLY if not exists
4. docs/design/mockups/*.html (pixel-perfect mockups with dark/light toggle)

Color selection (3-tier priority):
1. TIER 0: Check existing (tailwind.config.js, design-tokens.css) → USE THOSE
2. TIER 1: PRD mentions (brand colors, competitor refs) → USE THOSE
3. TIER 2: Domain psychology (healthcare=blue, finance=navy, ecommerce=neutral)
4. TIER 3: Generate 3 options with rationale if unclear

Typography: Use Google Fonts appropriate for domain.

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard nav, screen reader support.

Store design tokens in memory.

- value-objects.md (immutable value objects)
- domain-events.md (event catalog with triggers)
- sagas.md (long-running processes, compensating transactions)
- repositories.md (repository interfaces)
- services.md (domain and application services)
- database-schema.md (complete schema with migrations)
- migrations/XXX.sql (numbered migration files)

MINIMUM DDD ARTIFACTS:
- 3+ bounded contexts (Core + Supporting + Generic)
- 5+ aggregates (1-2 per context)
- 8+ entities (aggregates + children)
- 10+ value objects (Money, Email, Status, etc.)
- 6+ domain events (1 per aggregate transition)
- 5+ repositories (1 per aggregate root)
- 4+ services (domain + application)

Task("System Architect", `
Read PRD, requirements, DDD artifacts from memory.

Generate docs/adr/:
- index.md (ADR registry with dependency graph)
- ADR-001.md through ADR-027.md MINIMUM (each as SEPARATE file)

REQUIRED ADR TOPICS (1 ADR per topic = 27 minimum):

PLUS: Additional ADRs for PRD-specific decisions.

Each ADR = separate file. Enhanced template with metadata, alternatives, impact radius.

CRITICAL: DO NOT create just index.md. CREATE ALL INDIVIDUAL ADR FILES.

Before claiming done: ls docs/adr/ADR-*.md | wc -l (must be ≥27)

Store ADR index in memory.
`, "system-architect")

Task("SPARC Coordinator", `

## What You Do Next

1. **Read**: `docs/README.md` - Understand the documentation
2. **Review**: `docs/implementation/INDEX.md` - Your implementation guide
3. **Start Building**: Follow the tasks in order or use your own workflow

**That's it. No complex scripts. No guardian verification for docs. Just clean, complete documentation.**

---

## Quality Guarantees

Each generated document includes:

- ✅ Cross-references to related docs
- ✅ Traceability to PRD requirements
- ✅ No placeholder content (no TODO/TBD)
- ✅ Concrete decisions (no "we'll decide later")
- ✅ Complete coverage (minimums enforced)

**Minimum artifact counts** (auto-validated):

- 8+ specification files
- 27+ ADRs (one per architectural topic)
- 11+ DDD files
- 3+ bounded contexts
- 5+ aggregates
- 20+ tasks

If PRD is too vague, agents make explicit assumptions and document them.

---

## Execution Details

### Concurrency Model

- All 8 agents spawn in ONE message
- They execute in parallel (foreground mode)
- Task tool blocks until ALL agents complete
- Then INDEX.md is generated from their outputs
- Total time: 5-10 minutes (depends on PRD size)

### No Waves, No Checkpoints

- Simple: Spawn all → Wait → Generate index → Done
- No complex verification between phases
- No session checkpointing (not needed for docs)
- No retry logic (if agent fails, you see the error)

### Memory Coordination

Agents share via memory:

- Specification agent stores requirements → DDD agent reads
- DDD agent stores aggregates → Implementation planner reads
- All outputs → INDEX generator reads and integrates

---

## INDEX.md Contents

The generated INDEX.md provides:

### 1. Quick Start

```markdown
## How to Implement This

### By Milestone

1. M0: Foundation (8 tasks, 3 days) - Setup, database, auth
2. M1: MVP (24 tasks, 12 days) - Core features

---

## Customization

### Adjust Quality Bars

```bash
# Before running, set your thresholds
export PRD2BUILD_MIN_ADR_COUNT=15      # For MVP (default: 27)
export PRD2BUILD_MIN_AGGREGATES=3      # For simple app (default: 5)
export PRD2BUILD_MIN_TASKS=10          # For prototype (default: 20)

/prd2build my-prd.md
```

### Update Mode

```bash
# Update existing docs when PRD changes
/prd2build my-updated-prd.md --mode=update

# Compares against docs/source-prd.md
# Only regenerates changed sections
# Preserves custom edits
# Generates UPDATE-REPORT.md
```

## Example Execution

```bash
$ /prd2build ~/projects/my-saas/prd.md
