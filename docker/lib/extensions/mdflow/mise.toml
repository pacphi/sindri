# mdflow - Multi-backend CLI for markdown AI agents
# Requires nodejs extension to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: mdflow uses #!/usr/bin/env bun shebang, requiring bun at runtime.
# Bun must be installed BEFORE npm:mdflow so it's available when mdflow runs.

[tools]
# Bun runtime - required for mdflow execution (shebang: #!/usr/bin/env bun)
bun = "latest"

# mdflow CLI - transform markdown files into executable AI agents
"npm:mdflow" = "latest"
