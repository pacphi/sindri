# mdflow - Multi-backend CLI for markdown AI agents
# Requires nodejs extension to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: mdflow uses #!/usr/bin/env bun shebang, requiring bun at runtime.
# Bun must be installed BEFORE npm:mdflow so it's available when mdflow runs.
#
# NOTE: Use pinned versions instead of "latest" for reliable installations
# query timeouts that can poison subsequent mise operations.
