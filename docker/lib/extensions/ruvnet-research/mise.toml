# ruvnet-research.toml - AI research tools configuration for mise
# Requires nodejs extension to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: Use pinned versions instead of "latest"
# "latest" requires npm registry queries which can timeout.
#
# NOTE: research-swarm has native dependencies (better-sqlite3) that require
# node-gyp and build tools (gcc, python). If this extension fails during
# install, ensure build-essential is available in the Docker image.
