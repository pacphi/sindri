# Sindri Configuration - Docker Socket Binding
# Share host Docker daemon instead of running nested Docker
#
# Use this configuration when:
#   - You don't need true container isolation
#   - You want the best performance
#   - You're okay with containers being visible on host
#
# How it works:
#   - Mounts /var/run/docker.sock from host
#   - Docker commands inside container use host's daemon
#   - No nested Docker daemon, no storage driver issues
#
# Limitations:
#   - Containers created are siblings (visible on host)
#   - Less isolation than true DinD
#   - Cannot run different Docker versions
