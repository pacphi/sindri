# agentic-qe.toml - Agentic Quality Engineering v3 framework configuration for mise
# Requires nodejs extension to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: Use pinned versions instead of "latest" for reliable installations
# query timeouts that can poison subsequent mise operations.
#
# NOTE: The package name is @agentic-qe/v3 but the binary is still called 'aqe'
# (same as v2), so no migration needed for scripts.
