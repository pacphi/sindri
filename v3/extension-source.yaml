# Extension source configuration
# Defines where to fetch extensions from GitHub
#
# This file externalizes the repository configuration that was previously
# hardcoded in distribution.rs. Extensions are fetched from:
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{tag}/{base_path}/{name}/extension.yaml
#
# The CLI version tag (e.g., v3.0.0-alpha.5) is used to fetch extensions,
# meaning each CLI release corresponds to a snapshot of all extensions.

github:
  # Repository owner (GitHub username or organization)
  owner: "pacphi"

  # Repository name
  repo: "sindri"

  # Base path within the repository where extensions are located
  # Extensions are at: {base_path}/{extension_name}/extension.yaml
  base_path: "v3/extensions"
