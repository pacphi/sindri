# agentic-qe.toml - Agentic Quality Engineering v3 framework configuration for mise
# Requires nodejs extension to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: Use pinned versions instead of "latest" for reliable installations
# to avoid npm registry timeouts that can poison subsequent mise operations.
#
# NOTE: The npm package is 'agentic-qe' (not scoped). Binary is 'aqe'.
# DEPENDENCY FIX: v3.2.x requires lodash@^4.17.23 which doesn't exist (latest is 4.17.21).
# The extension's pre-install hook (setup-pnpm-hooks.sh) configures pnpm to remap this.
