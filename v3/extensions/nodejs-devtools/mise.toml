# nodejs-devtools.toml - npm global dev tools configuration for mise
# Requires nodejs.toml to be installed first
#
# IMPORTANT: Use pinned major.minor versions instead of "latest"
# Pinned versions provide reliable, reproducible installations without
# requiring network queries. pnpm's content-addressable store handles
# version resolution efficiently.

[tools]
# npm global development tools - pinned to major.minor for stability
# Installed via pnpm (configured in mise-config as npm.package_manager = "pnpm")
# NOTE: pnpm itself is NOT listed here - it's bootstrapped by nodejs extension
#       to avoid circular dependency (mise using pnpm to install pnpm)
