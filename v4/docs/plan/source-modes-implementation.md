## Sindri v4 — Source Modes Implementation Plan

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Implements:** ADR-028, DDD-08
**Amends:** `implementation-plan.md` Sprint 2 (registry) and Sprint 7 (CLI verbs)

This is a focused addendum to the v4 implementation plan covering the work to ship
ADR-028 (component source modes) and DDD-08 (registry source domain). It assumes the
existing Sprint 2 deliverables (OCI client, cache, lint, signing) are in place; the
existing `LocalRegistry` becomes the seed of the `LocalPath` source.

The work is sized as roughly **two sprints (≈4 weeks)** for one engineer, plus one
additional sprint of polish and CI integration that runs concurrently with other v4 work.

---

## Principles

- **No production behavior change without `--strict-oci` opt-out.** Default sindri.yaml
  scaffolding stays single-OCI; users opt in to other sources deliberately.
- **Source trait first, source variants second.** The trait contract is the design
  surface; concrete sources are conformance tests.
- **Lockfile is the contract.** Apply-time refetch reads `SourceDescriptor` only; if a
  descriptor cannot be re-resolved, apply fails loudly.
- **Refactor existing `LocalRegistry` rather than re-implement.** The work is mostly
  shaping current code into the new trait, not green-field writing.

---

## Phase 1 — Trait surface and refactor (Sprint A, week 1)

**Goal:** `Source` trait defined, `LocalPathSource` implemented as a refactor of
existing `LocalRegistry`, resolver consults a `Vec<RegistrySource>`. No behavior change
for existing users.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Define the `Source` trait and `RegistrySource` enum

- [ ] Create `sindri-registry/src/source/mod.rs` with the `Source` trait, `RegistrySource`
  enum, `SourceContext`, `SourceError`, and `SourceDescriptor` types from DDD-08.
- [ ] Add `scope: Option<Vec<ComponentName>>` to every variant; centralize the scope-check
  helper.
- [ ] Implement `RegistrySource::dispatch_*` (one per trait method) so the resolver can
  call through the enum without importing every variant.
- [ ] Add `schemars` derives so the new YAML shape lands in `v4/schemas/registry-source.json`.

#### 1.2 Refactor `LocalRegistry` into `LocalPathSource`

- [ ] Move `sindri-registry/src/local.rs` to `sindri-registry/src/source/local_path.rs`.
- [ ] Implement `Source` for `LocalPathSource`. `fetch_index` walks the path, reads
  `component.yaml` files, builds an in-memory `RegistryIndex`.
- [ ] Remove the old `LocalRegistry` symbol outright (v4 has no external consumers,
  so no transitional alias is kept).
- [ ] Tests: re-target the existing tests at `LocalPathSource`; add three new tests
  covering the scope filter.

#### 1.3 Resolver wiring

- [ ] `sindri-resolver/src/lib.rs` accepts `&[RegistrySource]` instead of a single
  registry handle. Use the existing first-match-wins helper from DDD-03 with the
  scope filter from §1.1.
- [ ] Lockfile gains `source: SourceDescriptor` per resolved component (DDD-08
  §"Lockfile descriptor"). Backfill via `From<old-shape>` for one release: read an
  absent `source:` as `SourceDescriptor::Oci { ... }` reconstructed from the
  pre-existing `registry:` field.
- [ ] Update `sindri-resolver/tests/` fixtures to assert the new field is populated.

### Acceptance criteria

- `cargo build --workspace` clean.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean.
- Existing v4 resolve fixtures pass unchanged.
- A new test resolves a single component from `LocalPathSource` and asserts the
  lockfile descriptor is `LocalPath { path }`.

---

## Phase 2 — `OciSource` and `LocalOciSource` (Sprint A, week 2)

**Goal:** Production OCI source is reachable via the new trait; `local-oci` reads OCI
image layouts on disk.

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Implement `OciSource`

- [ ] Create `sindri-registry/src/source/oci.rs` wrapping the existing
  `RegistryClient`/`CosignVerifier`/`RegistryCache`.
- [ ] `fetch_index` reuses cache-with-TTL semantics (DDD-02 §Cache Model).
- [ ] `supports_strict_oci()` returns `true` iff the trust config is satisfied — i.e.
  cosign signature verifies for `sindri/core` or for explicitly-trusted third parties.
- [ ] `lockfile_descriptor()` records `tag` + `manifest_digest`.
- [ ] Migrate two existing OCI integration tests from `sindri-registry/tests/` to
  exercise the trait surface; keep one direct-client test for the underlying client.

#### 2.2 Implement `LocalOciSource`

- [ ] Create `sindri-registry/src/source/local_oci.rs`. Use `oci-spec` for layout
  parsing; reuse `sigstore-rs` for embedded signature verification.
- [ ] `fetch_index` reads the layout's `index.json`, finds the registry-core artifact,
  unpacks the layers, parses `index.yaml`.
- [ ] `fetch_component_blob` reads layer blobs by digest from the layout.
- [ ] Tests: a fixture OCI layout under `v4/crates/sindri-registry/tests/fixtures/oci-layout/`
  (small but realistic — three components, signed and unsigned variants).

#### 2.3 `--strict-oci` gate

- [ ] Add `strict_oci: bool` to the resolver config; default `false`.
- [ ] After resolution, walk `Lockfile.components`; if any `source.supports_strict_oci()`
  is `false`, return `AdmissionCode::SourceNotProductionGrade`.
- [ ] Surface `--strict-oci` as a flag on `sindri lock` and `sindri resolve`; surface
  `registry.policy.strict_oci: true` in `sindri.yaml` (Q3 from ADR-028 — both).
- [ ] Loud warning at the top of every non-strict resolve report listing which sources
  produced which components.

### Acceptance criteria

- `--strict-oci` rejects a lockfile that contains a `LocalPath` source.
- `--strict-oci` accepts a lockfile that contains only verified `Oci` and `LocalOci`
  sources.
- `LocalOciSource` produces byte-for-byte the same component blob digests as the `OciSource`
  it was prefetched from (regression test).

---

## Phase 3 — `GitSource` and CLI verbs (Sprint B, week 1)

**Goal:** Git source resolves; `sindri registry serve` and `sindri registry prefetch`
exist.

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Implement `GitSource`

- [ ] Decision (recorded in this plan, not in the ADR): use `git2` (libgit2 bindings)
  rather than shelling out. Rationale: deterministic across user installs, no PATH
  dependence, supports sparse checkout for `subdir`.
- [ ] Cache layout: `~/.sindri/cache/git/<sha256(url)>/<commit-sha>/`.
- [ ] `fetch_index`: resolve `ref` to a commit sha, sparse-checkout `subdir` if set,
  walk `component.yaml` files.
- [ ] `lockfile_descriptor()` records the resolved commit sha — never the ref.
- [ ] `require_signed: true` rejects unverified commits; verification uses `gpgme` or
  shelled `git verify-commit` (TBD; add to Q-list if blocked).
- [ ] Tests: fixture local git repo (using `git2`'s in-memory repo helpers) with three
  components; resolve, then re-resolve to assert sha is recorded and reused.

#### 3.2 `sindri registry serve`

- [ ] New CLI verb in `sindri/src/commands/registry/serve.rs`.
- [ ] Spins up an ephemeral OCI registry over a components directory using
  `oci-distribution-spec` v1.1. (Implementation: a small embedded HTTP server using
  `axum` + `oci-distribution`.)
- [ ] Honors `--addr`, `--root`, `--sign-with` (optional cosign key for full-fidelity
  trust testing).
- [ ] Logs every push/pull to stdout; exits cleanly on SIGINT.

#### 3.3 `sindri registry prefetch`

- [ ] New CLI verb in `sindri/src/commands/registry/prefetch.rs`.
- [ ] Resolves the closure of one OCI ref into either a tarball (`--target air-gap.tar`)
  or an OCI image layout (`--layout ./vendor/registry-core`).
- [ ] Reuses `OciSource` for fetch; uses `oci-spec` to write the layout.
- [ ] Q1 from ADR-028 (`--with-binaries`) is **deferred**; this phase does registry
  artifact only.

#### 3.0 Prerequisites carried over from Phase 2

- [ ] Implement real `OciSource::fetch_component_blob` (per-component OCI layer
  streaming). Phase 2 stubbed this as `NotImplemented` because Phase 2's
  acceptance only required index-level fetch; `sindri registry prefetch`
  (§3.3) needs real layer bytes, so this lands as a Phase 3 prerequisite.
- [ ] Implement real `LocalOciSource::fetch_component_blob` (read layer blobs
  from the on-disk OCI image layout by digest). Same rationale as above —
  `prefetch` round-trip from `OciSource` to `LocalOciSource` requires both
  sides to stream real bytes.
- [ ] Audit the `OciSource::supports_strict_oci()` trust-scope logic for
  third-party registries: Phase 2 left the per-component override matching
  to the resolver wiring above the source rather than duplicating it inside
  the source. Confirm this is correct or pull the override check into the
  source if Phase 3's wiring patterns demand it.

### Acceptance criteria

- `sindri lock` resolves a component from a `GitSource` pointing at a feature branch
  and records the commit sha in the lockfile.
- `sindri registry serve --root ./components` is reachable from `oras pull`.
- `sindri registry prefetch oci://… --layout ./out` produces a directory that
  `LocalOciSource` reads identically to the original OCI source.

---

## Phase 4 — Config, docs, CI templates (Sprint B, week 2)

**Goal:** Users can express the new shape; CI templates ship; docs are honest.

### Tasks

#### 4.1 sindri.yaml schema and merge semantics

- [x] Update `v4/schemas/bom.json` to allow `registry.sources: [...]` with the four
  variants. (Done — `BomManifest.registries: Vec<RegistryConfig>` replaced by
  `BomManifest.registry: RegistrySection { sources, policy, replace_global }`. Schema
  regenerated. See PR `refactor(v4): migrate registry config to registry.sources: shape`.)
- [x] Update the `init` template to write the new shape (single `oci` source). (Done.)
- [ ] Document merge semantics: project sources prepend to global sources by default;
  `registry.replace_global: true` overrides. (Pending — `replace_global` field is wired
  and serializes correctly; runtime multi-file merge logic is a separate Phase 4 task.)

#### 4.2 `--explain` for sources

- [ ] Extend `sindri lock --explain <component>` to show every source that was
  consulted, whether it matched, why it was skipped (out of scope, not found),
  and what descriptor was recorded.
- [ ] Match output style to existing `BackendChooser --explain` output.

#### 4.3 CI template

- [ ] Add `v4/docs/ci/strict-oci.yml` — a GitHub Actions snippet enabling
  `--strict-oci` on every `sindri lock` invocation in CI.
- [ ] Reference it from the v4 user-facing docs alongside the existing CI guidance.

#### 4.4 Migration note

- [ ] Append a section to `v4/docs/MIGRATION_FROM_V3.md` (or seed the file) explaining
  how v3's "resolve from GitHub" maps to a v4 `git` source, and how v3's bundled
  registry pattern maps to `local-oci`. Cross-link to
  [`v4/docs/SOURCES.md`](../SOURCES.md) (the maintainer guide, authored in
  Phase 1) rather than duplicating its decision matrix.
- [ ] Cross-link from ADR-003 §"Air-gapped / offline" once the migration doc lands.
- [ ] Update SOURCES.md "Phase status" table as Phases 2/3 land so its source-by-source
  status stays accurate.

### Acceptance criteria

- `cargo run -p sindri -- lock --explain mise:nodejs` prints source consultation order.
- `cargo run -p sindri -- init` writes a sindri.yaml that uses the new `sources:` shape.
- A user pasting the strict-oci CI snippet into a fresh repo gets a passing run that
  fails the moment a `LocalPath` source is introduced.

---

## Phase 5 — Optional polish (concurrent with later sprints)

These are improvements that should not block the v4.0 RC but should be tracked.

- [ ] **`--with-binaries`** for `sindri registry prefetch` (ADR-028 Q1).
  Requires the prefetch step to know target platforms; coordinate with Sprint 9
  (Target subsystem).
- [ ] **HTTPS tarball source** (`type: http-tarball`) — natural extension of the
  trait; useful for legacy distribution channels. Defer until a real user asks.
- [ ] **`s3://` source** — for organizations that already have S3-backed mirrors but
  not OCI. Same trait, new variant.
- [ ] **Source-level cache eviction policy** in `~/.sindri/cache/git/`. Currently
  unbounded; needs an LRU policy in line with the OCI cache TTL.

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
| `git2` build complexity on Windows runners | Pin libgit2 system feature off; ship vendored libgit2 by default. |
| `oci-distribution-spec` server library is immature | If `axum` + `oci-distribution` is too thin, fall back to shelling out to `zot` for `registry serve`; the verb is a developer convenience, not a production path. |
| Lockfile schema churn alarms users | Backfill is implemented in Phase 1.3; add a one-line warning on first read of a legacy lockfile. |
| `--strict-oci` not noticed in CI templates | Loud warning in non-strict mode listing source mix; ship the CI template; mention in release notes. |
| Source-trait surface grows uncontrolled as more variants land | Conformance test crate that every new source must pass; review at ADR level for any new variant beyond the four in ADR-028. |

---

## Out of scope

- Discovery (`sindri ls`, `sindri search`) source attribution. The discovery domain
  (DDD-06) reads a merged `RegistryIndex` and does not need to know which source it
  came from.
- Per-source rate limiting, retry, or circuit-breaking. Each source's transport
  concerns are local; cross-source policy is a v4.1 problem.
- Dynamic source registration via plugin. The four source types are baked in; new
  types require an ADR.
